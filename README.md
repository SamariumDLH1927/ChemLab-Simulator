# ChemLab-Simulator
This is a program of simulating a flow chemistry lab's teaching experiment.
In this experiment, we will synthesize solvent yellow 7 with flow chemistry apparatus, and analyze chemical kinetics of this reaction.

The newest exe file is a full edition, which you can try it and play it to study the experiment. This is a complete software you can apply in a teaching laboratory.
Also, if there is any bug, please let me know with your comments. I will continuously update and fix the minor bugs.
Thank your using this simulator! :D
