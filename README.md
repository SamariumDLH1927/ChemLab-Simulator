# ChemLab-Simulator
This is a program of simulating a flow chemistry lab's teaching experiment.
In this experiment, we will synthesize solvent yellow 7 with flow chemistry apparatus, and analyze chemical kinetics of this reaction.

The newest rar file contains an exe file, which is the full edition, which you can try it and play it to study the experiment. This is a complete software you can apply in a teaching laboratory.
Also, if there is any bug, please let me know with your comments. I will continuously update and fix the minor bugs.
Thank your using this simulator! :D

Some tips:

In the pages of experiment preparation, if you do not know what to do, you can actually try to click anywhere on the screen, and then you can easily find how to continue ;-)
In the pages of kinetic experiment and low flow-rate experiment, you can accelerate the process by choose the "Time = x.x (s)" in the bottom, which means you can obtain one data spot within x.x seconds. That is being said, if you choose 0.1 s, then you are in a ten times faster speed.
When analyzing data, if you are not satisfied with one group of data and would like to ignore it, you can just right click on it, and choose the resulting "ignore" choice.

The solutions may be used up. 0.1% HCl has to be prepared again as the solvent if it is used up.
In experiment preparation, you have prepared the solutions enough for 100 groups of experiment.
After 100 trials, you will have to skip to the analysis part. But don't worry. The data can be export as a csv file, and you can restart this simulator. You can gather these data together and try to analysis them on your own.

And lastly, have a good time enjoy the simulator in chemlab! Have fun! :D
